    "__Ans:__ Arrays in Python are Data Structures that can hold multiple values of the same type. Often, they are misinterpreted as lists or Numpy Arrays. Technically, Arrays in Python are distinct from both these. \n",

    " - In arrays, the elements can be accessed randomly by using the index number. \n",
